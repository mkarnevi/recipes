# Smoky bean stew with cheat's aioli

## Ingredients

* 1 red onion
* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 10 fresh sage or 1 tsp of dried sage
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 tbsp tomato purée
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 200 ml white wine
* 800 g tinned butter beans (2 x 400g tins)
* 1 ciabatta (250g)
* 3 tbsp mayonnaise
* 10g fresh parsley

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200C
2. Halve, peel and finely dice the onion. Tip 2 tbsp of the oil into a medium saucepan and place it over medium heat. Once the oil begin to loosen and shimmer, lower in 3/4 of the onion and a pinch of salt. 
3. Fry the onion for 5-6 minutes until softened. While you wait, finely chop the sage, then peel and finely grate the garlic
4. Once the onion has softened in places, tip in 3/4 of the garlic, all the sage, tomato purée and the smoked paprika. Fry for a further 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. 
5. Tip in the white wine. Boil for 2-3 minutes, until reduced by 3/4. 
6. Chuck the tins of butter beans in the pan - no need to drain them. 
7. Give everything a stir, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 7-10 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by 1/2. Get on with the rest of the dish while you wait. 
8. Rip the ciabatta into bite-sized chunks and scatter them onto a small tray. Drizzle over the remaining oil. Bake in the oven for 5-7 mins until golden brown and crisp. Get on with the rest of the dish while you wait.
9. Beat the mayonnaise with the remaining garlic and season to taste with salt. Set aside for later. Chop the parsley.
10. Once the stew is ready, tip in the bread and give everything a good mix. Allow the stew to stand for 1-2 minutes to give the bread time to soften lightly. 
11. Season to taste with salt and pepper, fold through the 3/4 of the parsley and divide between bowls. Scatter over remaining onion and parsley, dollop on the aioli and serve!
