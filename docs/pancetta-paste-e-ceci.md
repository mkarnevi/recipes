# Pancetta pasta e ceci

Serves 2

## Ingredients

* 140g pancetta
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 200g dried pasta
* 2 tbsp tomato purée 
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled
* 400g chickpeas (1 tin)
* 1 tsp chilli flakes (1/2 tsp for kids)
* 15g fresh parsley (6-7g is enough)

## Method

1. Put on a medium saucepan with water to boil for the pasta.
2. Add the pancetta and olive oil to a large frying pan, and place it over medium-high heat. Allow the fat to render from the pancetta, then fry for 5-8 minutes, until golden and crisp in places. Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait.
3. When the water is boiling, add pasta and a generous pinch of salt to the saucepan. Cook the pasta for 8-10 minutes, until soft but still with a slight bite (al dente). Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait.
4. Once the pancetta is ready, add tomato purée and finely grated or pressed cloves of garlic. Fry for a further 2-3 minutes, until the tomato paste starts to darken. 
5. Add 1 undrained tin of chickpeas to the pan, along with chilli flakes. Toss to coat, and whack the heat up to high. Boil for 2-3 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half. 
6. Finely chop the parsley
7. Once the pasta and sauce are ready, use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the pasta from the pan to the sauce. 
8. Add 3/4 of the parsley, then toss to coat and season to taste with salt. Loosen with a splash of the pasta’s cooking water if the mix looks a little thick or claggy. 
9. Divide the pasta between plates, top with the remaining parsley and serve.
